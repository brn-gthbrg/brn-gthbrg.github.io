  <h1>More Information</h1>
  <h2>Guest Policies</h2>
    <p>KFSC members can purchase guest passes in blocks of 10, and are available to KFSC
    members only. Individual passes are not available. Passes are kept on file at KFSC and are
    valid for as long as membership is maintained.</p>

    <p>A maximum of 2 guests at a time per member family is allowed unless prior arrangements have
    been made with the manager. Members must register their guest(s) at the front desk and remain at
    the pool with them.</p>

    <p>A valid Liability Release form for each guest must be on file at KFSC. (See the "Forms" page)</p>

  <h2>Parties</h2>
    <p>Members wishing to schedule a party at the pool must make arrangements with the manager at least
    2 weeks in advance. A maximum of 10 guests is allowed at parties. A $100 deposit is required. This
    privilege is available to members only. If you have any questions, call (408) 241-3609 or see the pool manager.</p>

  <h2>Barbecue Area</h2>
    <p>The BBQ is available on a first-come, first-serve basis. Users must provide their own supplies,
    including charcoal and matches. Anything left at the BBQ is done at the individual's own risk. Please
    clean the BBQ when you are finished so that it will be ready for the next users.</p>

  <h2>Membership Rebates</h2>
    <p>KFSC offers a $100 rebate to any returning KFSC member who brings in a new member family. The
    rebate will be paid when the 2017 membership of both the  returning family and the new family have
    been paid in full. There is a 4 family limit (i.e. up to $400) to the number of rebates a returning family
    can earn. To ensure that a returning family receives credit for a new member, the new member
    should put the returning family's name on section 4 of the Membership Form. If you have any
    questions about this program, please contact one of the pool managers.</p>

  <h2>Lap Lane Swimming</h2>
    <p>During free swim sessions, one lap lane is reserved for Lap Swimming. During the 15-minute
    breaks, the entire pool is available to anybody 16 or older who wishes to lap swim or play.</p>
